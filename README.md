# pythonImageRecog

This is a small project that I worked on using Amazon Web services(AWS) and its three servers: IAM, S3(simple storage service) and Lambda to build an image recognition program using python scripts. Once the program is implemented, it identifies the image of the object that is provided to its key and tells the user what type of object it is as well as its accuracy with comparisons to its google image.
